   <h1>Question 3</h1>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I have always wanted to make things. As a toddler, I drew all over the walls of my room with markers and loved to make up stories playing with my toy cars. Growing up, lots of my free time as a kid was spent listening to music, dancing to music, and writing stories and comics on pieces of printer paper. While I am no genius, I have always been a creative person since childhood and until now as almost an adult. Art has significantly impacted my identity in many ways, and it has added many layers of value to my life.<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When I was in grade 6, one of my older friends showed me a webcomic he started on the webcomic sharing platform <span style="font-style:italic">LINE Webtoon</span>. At that point, I was an enthusiastic artist and I loved doodling pictures and comics and characters on scrap paper and schoolwork (my art skills have unfortunately not evolved past grade 7 level). Around that time, I was given a touchscreen laptop for my birthday, and I began creating my own webcomics. I made several changes with the comic name, art styles and characters throughout my 3 years in junior high school as an artist, but my longest running webcomic was a panel called Oranges + Salt. I made about 20 episodes of the comic, each usually 4-5 panels of setup and punchline of silly absurdist humour with minimalistically but meticulously drawn cartoon-style character.s The name had no meaning other than I thought it sounded cool, and the webcomic was not terribly good - the writing and illustration was up to par with any young junior high school student with a drawing tablet. But Oranges + Salt was my magnum opus as a 12 year old, and nothing made me prouder than running my own webcomic and showing my artistic skills and joke-writing to the world. My comics would get 40 to 60 viewers per episode (mostly friends and family), and I never felt so proud creating a work out of my own talent and humour into something bigger than myself, in this case an audience of faithful viewers and subscribers. My comic writing soon expanded from my Webtoon into working as a comic artist for my elementary school newspaper and collaborating with other artists and friendsâ€™ comics online. My Webtoon ran from 2018 to 2021, as I stopped drawing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then my source of creativity has shifted from doodling to making music, but I have not put down my pen nor stopped making and sharing creative projects.<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Creating a webcomic motivated me to keep practicing and learning about drawing, and expanded a creative hobby of mine into what I felt was my greatest accomplishment. I knew from birth that I loved making stuff, and my experience running a webcomic affirmed myself as an artist, someone who projected their personality and skills onto an original body of work that was much larger than myself. Oranges + Salt is only the start of a long list of creative projects that demonstrates the value art gives to my life as a creative outlet, a personal challenge of creative skill and self-improvement, and a written & aural form of self-expression.<br />

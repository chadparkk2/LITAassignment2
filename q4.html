   <h1>Question 4</h1>
    <p class="text">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My whole life, I have always been creating art. From building with LEGOs and making video games with code to writing and producing songs, I have spent my whole life in creative pursuit, working on projects from art to technology to literature to pass the time. When I make art, I am thoroughly entertained making something that is original to me and expresses either a part of my imagination, a personal message or my fascination with a particular interest or artistic concept. My favourite hobbies growing up ranged from building legos, drawing comics, and coding video games to learning new instruments, playing in bands and acting in musicals.Now as a high school student, my artistic ventures are solely focused on music, as one of my favourite things to do that entertains my sense of creativity and engages my curiosity and need to learn more. <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am always happier the more I play - as a part of musical ensembles at school and in Calgary, I make the most of my skills by constantly putting them to the test in rehearsals, concerts and festivals. By myself, I am always working on side projects that expand my artistic capabilities and well-roundedness by learning to play music of different cultures and styles, using technology to make everything from music to art, and reading about all sorts of history from mythology, artistic tradition and political history to pull inspiration from. By building something bigger than myself and entertaining my sense of creativity, art gives me happiness by allowing me to make the music I want to see in the world. Two milestones I wish to accomplish along my artistic journey is to record and produce my own album of music to present a personal message and build my personal style/artistic voice, and become a master of musical style, technique and versatility on the drums to fully realize my creative potential and express myself to the best of my ability.<br />
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Through creating the art I wish to see in the world, I wish not just to assert my artistic capabilities but to inspire others by establishing a creative legacy that precedes my reputation as a friend or a neighbour or even myself as a person. I genuinely hope to become one of the greats in musical and artistic tradition, not out of a desire for fame or success but to inspire creativity and greatness in others around me and in the world. My ambition drives me no matter my chances of success or failure, to garner a creative influence that inspires others as a master of my own work. I hope one day to be a major voice in music or jazz culture, innovating culture as a unique talent and artistic voice in the context of greater music history.<br />
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Through pursuing the arts, I hope to add value in my life by continuing the happiness I get from creating, maximizing my creative potential, and creating a legacy of art that becomes a major influence for artists and  audiences alike today and in history.<br />

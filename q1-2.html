   <h1>Question 1 & 2: <span style="font-style:italic">Piss Christ</span> Defines Art</h1>
    <img class="cover" src="pisschrist.jpg">
    <p class="text">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style="font-style:italic">Immersion (Piss Christ)</span> by American photographer Andreas Serrano depicts a small plastic crucifix submerged in an amber and yellow haze - Serrano’s urine. When the piece was exhibited in 1989 after winning the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art's "Awards in the Visual Arts" competition, outrage erupted among the American public. Andreas Serrano, a devout Catholic, wanted to shock people with a commentary on modern society’s commercialization of Christian iconography. However, this did not stop the American public from outrage. To many, this piece was a work of blasphemy, degeneracy and an affront to the Christian values of America, funded by their very own tax dollars through prize money given by the National Endowment for Arts. At the head of this reaction against <span style="font-style:italic">Piss Christ</span> was Republican North Carolina senator Jesse Helms and New York senator Al D’Amato, whose main target was the National Endowments for the Arts, a government art institution who awarded modern artists with controversial works sponsorships and prize money, including $15000 to Serrano. Helms, D’Amato and a league of conservative senators and political think tanks denounced the work as “immoral trash” and called for the defunding and reform of the Endowments for the Arts to stop funding debaucherous artists like Andres Serranos who “insult the very fundamental basis of [the United States of America]”. Senator D’Amato even went to the Senate floor and tore up a picture of <span style="font-style:italic">Piss Christ</span> during a Congressional hearing. After the first wave of controversy that followed <span style="font-style:italic">Piss Christ</span> national exhibition, the late 80s in the US was marked by a massive surge of protest against contemporary art exhibition and funding. Thousands protested at contemporary art exhibits and wrote furious letters to their government representatives, calling an end to the promotion of such depraved and immoral modern “art”. <br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But when a Philadelphia museum withdrew its exhibitions of Robert Mapplethorpe, a photographer famous for his pictures with homoerotic and sexual themes in 1989, Senator Helms’ office called the museum the next day and furiously demanded to know why the exhibit had been pulled and called for the museum to keep its exhibition open. This begs the question: If you thought that a piece of art was damaging to society, wouldn’t you want to remove it? Why fan the flames and platform “immoral trash” onto the Senate floor and American museums? My guess is with the Philadelphia museum’s director, who said about Helms’ call: "I have to conclude they really wanted that exhibition in Washington, so it would fuel their fire." Although Helms and D’Amato never called for the direct censorship of contemporary art, the politics they pushed showed a deeper concern than fiscal policy. After all, millions more were given to marching bands than were ever given to Serrano or Mapplethorpe. The true intention behind the cultural pushback was that the art offended reactionary traditionalists in America, who thought that art was supposed to affirm traditional values and glorify American culture. To the senators and their crowd of offended Americans, works like <span style="font-style:italic">Piss Christ</span> were not worthy to be considered, let alone be funded as art. Real art was supposed to reflect good old American values and Christian heritage - it was Norman Rockwell and Washington Crossing the Delaware or bust.<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Senator Jesse Helms’ amendment to defund the NEA of grant money was never passed, but the impacts of his movement against modern and contemporary art endures to this day. Governments have increasingly proposed cuts to the NEA’s budgets, pressuring the National Endowments for the Arts to be conservative with funding arts programs and artistic grants. Recently, executive orders for the defunding of the National Endowments for the Arts have been signed by current US President Donald Trump, who has suggested the complete defunding of the NEA. The reaction against Andres Serrano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Piss Christ</span> and to the funding of contemporary art in the late 1980s led to the decline of funding towards the arts in the United States and increasing political pressure upon arts institutions.<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While I find myself engaged with Andreas Serrano’s commentary on spirituality , I cannot say I find the art as beautiful as other works of historical art. As someone who is unfamiliar with artistic history nuance, contemporary art is to me inaccessible and hard to understand in depth. I am not alone in favouring old art to new art. In music, elitism has grown rampant among classical and jazz artists and listeners in reaction to modern pop music. In the classical music world, there is a minority sentiment among listeners that the European 18th and 19th century is superior to modern pop or country music because it is more musically complex and derives from a rich musical tradition. Those with limited knowledge or appreciation for advanced art often find boundary-pushing art hard to understand and therefore hard to define as art, while pretentious artists claim certain art objectively more sophisticated than others based on artistic or historic merit. But the idea of defining art with a prescribed role in society and a cultural standard and rejecting modern arts can prove dangerous - it aligns with a philosophy called reactionism, which is the idea that modern society is filled with degeneracy and far from some greatness of the past, where cultural standards, social norms and politics affirmed an objective morality.<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The notion of returning society to a historical standard of greatness, when taken to the extreme, forms the basis of racism, sexism, homophobia & other forms of hate. Throughout his 30 years as a Senator, Jesse Helms’ legacy is infamous for his opposition to civil rights and his openly homophobic politics. His protection of “traditional American values” goes back to his opposition to the Civil Rights Act and denial of funding HIV/AIDS research. What motivated his controversial politics was his mission to assert Christianity as an objective moral and societal standard that affirmed the American way of life, and defend it against those pushing against the status quo and bring America farther from God. When Robert Mapplethorpe received funding from the NEA, Jesse Helms was outraged because of what it represented - a challenge to traditional norms and demographic representation in art. To Helms, boundary-pushing “art” inspires change against societal convention in art and politics, aligning itself with other progressive movements that challenge the status quo of society. The defunding of the NEA was never about the quality of art or the use of tax dollars. It was about defending America from the broader liberal agenda that affronted the way society should be - including traditional establishments such as racial segregation and LGBTQ+ inequality. But if you really thought that this social change was damaging to society, wouldn’t you want to quietly take down art exhibits and civil rights protests?<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;20th century Germany fostered many famous and notable modern art movements from impressionism to the Bauhaus school to surrealism. But when the National Socialist Party came to prominence in Germany in the early 1930s, they appealed to the German public by promising to return the nation to a prior state of greatness during the Holy Roman Empire. The Nazis seemingly held a great respect for the arts; Joseph Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda, said that artists were “divine gifted purveyors of meaning” and spent lots of funding on art exhibitions and museums. Mythologizing the great works of their predecessors, the Romans and Greeks, the Nazis promoted art that replicated and glorified traditional German values and suppressed art that did not feed into the cultural narrative. As German art began to reflect ancient mythology, this art began to reflect German heroism, becoming part of its mythology. The cycle of art being based on mythology which became based on art cyclically proved the Nazis’ own cultural and intellectual supremacy. The art that fell outside the national aesthetic, was compiled into an exhibit titled Entartete Kunst or Degenerate Art. Thousands of works from hundreds of artists including Henri Matisse, Picasso and Van Gogh were publicly mocked as morally repulsive abstractions that could only be made by the mentally sick. Beside the thousands of impressionist, avant-garde and modernist paintings in the degenerate art exhibit were the price tags that showed how much each painting and sculpture sold for, inviting mockery and rage in the general public. Clearly, the valuation of this immoral trash was proof of a socialist anJewish conspiracy against the German people, who bought and sold art that challenged the German values and societal institutions of the traditional family, gender roles, anti-semitism and classical artistic traditions. The “degenerate intellectualism” of black and Jewish artists tried to mix the culture of the “civilized” and the “uncivilized”. Surely, no one in their right mind could ever consider the debauchery created by modern artists “real art”, and it was simply outrageous that government institutions and museums funded the mockery of the German people. Real art stood up to the obvious artistic standard of German culture, promoting traditional values and the way of German life. Why did the Nazis show the art that supposedly denigrated society? They really wanted that exhibit in Munich so it would fuel their fire, manufacturing anger towards the “Jewish agenda”, anger that justified the atrocities committed against Jews, homosexuals and other minorities during the Nazi Regime.<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Disliking modern or contemporary art does not align yourself as a reactionist or make you a Nazi. If you dislike any painting or music made after the 19th century, that is an entirely just opinion. Although Helms and German fascists both held reactionist views on art, in no way are they equal to one another in their politics. When I reflect on the question “What makes something ‘art’ or ‘not art’” or “what differentiates ‘good art’ from ‘bad art’”, I am reminded of the danger of holding objectivist definitions of art, which were used by people from Jesse Helms to German fascists to justify hate and political motives. Art is always breaking its own boundaries and redefining itself, and to hold an objective no-exceptions definition of art risks silencing new forms of self-expression. Art is famously hard to define, and many people who claim a definition of art are trying to sell a political or social narrative. For these reasons, my definitions of art and what good art constitutes is entirely subjective. The only objective belief I have about what is and isn’t art, is that it should only be defined descriptively, and never in an objective manner. I can only define what art is and what good art is in relation to my perception and enjoyment of it, but the only closer you can get to a true definition of art is whatever your definition of art is.<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In my personal opinion, art is the self-expression of humanity through creation, whether it be through music, painting, photography, drama or sculpture. Art can reflect an artist’s emotional state, social, political or spiritual message, or an ideal of beauty. It also accurately reflects the human condition, not being a result of an automated process such as artificial intelligence or a measured product of an objective process without any meaning. One example of something I do not consider “art” is art made by artificial intelligence, through tools such as ChatGPT or DALL-E among others. One might argue that a human must give the AI a prompt and fulfill the requirement of human expression, but to me, because the basis of AI generation uses neural networks and a machine learning algorithm to make an image, there is no actual creativity involved in generating art, rather using a  system of logic gates and a database to replicate existing art, separating any humanity an AI’s product and its human prompt.<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Good art succeeds at being art - portraying some aspect of the human condition or imagination. I really enjoy <span style="font-style:italic">Piss Christ</span>; one reason is the unique delivery of its message. Looking up at the crucifix, the amber and yellow haze invokes an air of mystery. When I first saw the piece I guessed the recoloration signified a shifted version of the baptism of Christ during his death. I will never forget the initial shock and confusion when I looked at the caption of the photo titled <span style="font-style:italic">Piss Christ</span>. My first impression of the full piece was mixed with confusion and a sense of awe. Christ’s death was as vulgar as piss, a most humiliating death for the Son of God - yet the crucifixion lost its reverence in my mind when I saw it in the light of its vulgarity. Not all good art invokes a powerful reaction or contains some unique or eye-opening insight about human nature. But good art accurately reflects an artist's imagination, reveals a strongly personal artistic statement and some level of technical feat or personal depth. Bad art displays either an unclear or half-effort artistic intent, a lack of creativity, or a critical misunderstanding about humanity. Many pop songs released today are “bad” or at least subpar art. While I am a fan of pop music and have expressed my disdain for musical elitism, many of the songs that are popular today are instrumentally generic and uncreative, with lyrics that display a lack of depth or personal focus in order to appeal to as many fans as possible to sell out records. Art made with a strong intent for commodification loses the voice of the artist, as well as any depth in portraying humanity or imagination. Commodified art cheapens itself, judging itself for its aesthetic value and how much utility it serves. This obfuscation of artistic intent and a lack of creativity leads me to call much of pop music and corporate art “bad art”.<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you asked me to list my favourite art pieces, from movies to music to buildings that I consider to be good art, you will find many exceptions to my own rules. My definition of art is purely subjective, normative and prone to exceptions. That is the only thing I get right about the nature of art. The task of defining art and finding a criteria for “good” or “bad“ art has been explored by countless intellectuals, philosophers, artists and audiences alike. It is common for people trying to define art to use an objective lens and material parameters for its definition, such as how one would classify a new species of tree or distinguish rocking chairs from couches. However, art is a human invention that is incredibly unique. It is a human concept as ubiquitous as culture, known by every human civilization, yet arbitrarily recognized. Changing the way we think about art can change our perception of the world and our personal beliefs. Art plays a role in how we define our religious beliefs, from who we are in relation to others, to the rules around us that dictate the order society and art, how we can end of capitalism, end socialism, legislate change against prejudice, or genocide an entire human population. The scandal around <span style="font-style:italic">Piss Christ</span> and the demonization of art by the Nazi party reminds me that caution is needed when defining art, which holds incredible power over human behaviour, but also that the only people I need to impress and the standards my work has to meet are defined by myself and myself only.<br />
